# C++ Module 00

An introduction to the basics of C++. Relatively simple, the same way the Piscine C00 was simple.
You'll learn basic C++ syntax, namespaces, classes, members, and a few other concepts. There are only 3 exercises in this module.

## Exercise 00: Megaphone
Toupper(), but in a program. The program takes in your argument, coverts it to all capitals, and prints the output to the terminal.
