# C++ Module 00

An introduction to the basics of C++. Relatively simple, the same way the Piscine C00 was simple.
You'll learn basic C++ syntax, namespaces, classes, members, and a few other concepts. There are only 3 exercises in this module.

## Exercise 00: Megaphone
Toupper(), but in a program. The program takes in your argument, coverts it to all capitals, and prints the output to the terminal.

## Exercise 01: PhoneBook
Creating a simple phonebook. It's up to you how pretty you want it to look. But the general rules are:
* PhoneBook can only store a maximum of **8** contacts. The 9th will replace the oldest and so on.
* The PhoneBook must be an instance of the PhoneBook class, and contacts an instance of the Contact class.
* On start-up the phonebook is empty, and user is prompted to enter one of three commands:
	* [ ADD ] : Save a new contact.
		* The contact fields are: first name, last name, nickname, phone number, and
darkest secret. A saved contact canâ€™t have empty fields.
